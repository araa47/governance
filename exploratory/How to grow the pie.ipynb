    "# How to grow the pie (in consulting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Human organizations tend to move to higher levels of entropy unless there is a concerted effort to keep members of that organization working together. For a profesional consulting organization like d5.ai where members contribute their time and effort hoping that the collective action will bring higher returns that individual action in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to incentivice working towards the common goals of the organization, here we'll propose several mechanisms that will help on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the relay mechanism for growing the pot\n",
    "\n",
    "All the relay payments are paid to a wallet belonging to the DAO and the governance of the DAO is modified proportional to that deposit. So say that the initial pot size of the DAO is **0**, and governance tokens are evenly split. The state of the DAO will be (the array represents goverance tokens for Alex, Toni, Evgeny, Lars, Mats, Guy, Anders):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(0, [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Alex relays a 10000 job to Toni. Alex gets the 1000 relay in DAI that goes to the DAO and Toni gets 9k$ in cash as a result of the job performed. The state of the DAO changes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1000, [2000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ownership for Alex of d5.ai goes from $0.1428$ to $0.25$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now d5.ai agrees on paying dividends to all members using the whole pot, Alex will get 250 DAI and all other members will get 125 DAI. Now the state of the DAO is \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(0, [2000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is Toni who finds a 10000 gig and relays to Alex. The state of the DAO changes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1000, [2000, 2000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we find that we are lagging on our Medium post publication rate and it is impacting our brand awareness. In the bounty session we assign Evegeny with a 500 tokens bounty for creating a new blog post. The DAO state changes to \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1000, [2000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We again split dividends and Toni and Alex get 2/9 of the pot, Evegeny 1/6, the rest of the team gets 1/9. Compared to what one would get by relaying if this mechanism wasn't in place the net result is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alex:   -540 \\$  (250 + 210 - 1000)\n",
    "- Toni:   -665 \\$  (125 + 210 - 1000) \n",
    "- Evgeny: +282 \\$  (125 + 166)\n",
    "- Rest:   +230 \\$  (125 + 105)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try to formalize some parameters in the scenario above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a 1 to 1 correspondence between DFC and DAI\n",
    "- $C$ is the initial DFC capital in the DAO, in the example $C = 1000$\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the constant by which relay money to the DAO is reflected as an increase in DFC for the relayer user. In the example $\\alpha = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that this mechanism discourages contributing to the DAO because doing nothing is more beneficial than relaying unless internal tasks for the DAO (like Evgeny's in the example) bring more value than otherwise. \n",
    "So let's define a multiplier $k \\geq 1$ that defines how DFC spent in the DAO brings relays that otherwise wouldn't happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's perform some simulations using different values for the constants. The first thing I thought of is the initial DFC assigned to each member in order to prevent a \"dictator\" to gain much power in the initial stages of the DAO but maybe a mechanism of `rage quitting` is enough. "
